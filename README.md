# Programming Assignment 3

<b>Given:</b> September 10, 2024
<br/><b>Deadline:</b> September 17, 2024

## I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
  1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
  2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library

## II. Instructions:
  Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin. <br/>
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > For this programming assignment, download the following file and save to your default user folder: http://bit.ly/Cars_file

### PROBLEM 1: Heads and Tails Functions
  > [!NOTE]
  > Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py
 
  Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:<br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas <br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars

### PROBLEM 2: Indexing and Slicing
  > [!NOTE]
  > Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py
  
  Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.<br/><br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.<br/><br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.<br/><br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?<br/><br/>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

## III. Utilized Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  > [!NOTE]
  > Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Navigator

## IV. Libraries
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > It is essential to import this library:
  > ``` import pandas as pd ```
